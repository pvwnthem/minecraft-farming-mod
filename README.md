# Minecraft Farming Mod 1.19.4
This is my first ever minecraft mod.

## Description

This mod aims to add extra items, tools, and objectives to the boring farming system in minecraft!

## Features
This mod features many new items and tools including custom hoes and higher tier items for every farm crop.
Each one of these special hoes  grants a chance to drop an enchanted one of the crop you are farming as long as it matches the hoe.
More functionality for these enchanted items will be added in the future!

## Villagers
This mod includes a custom villager called the senior farmer. This villager includes a random chance to include a buy and sell trade for each item
included in the mod. The farmers workbench is the workstation needed to create the villager which can be crafted by arranging 4 normal carrots and 4 of any planks like this 
where Cs are carrots and #s are planks
- C#C
- #C#
- C#C

## Crafting
You can craft every enchanted crop in this mod by using arranging 8 of the lesser crop in this configuration (0 is empty space)
- XXX
- X0X
- XXX
 
And you can craft the next tier of that crop by arranging 8 of the enchanted crops in the same configuration
